Tracker
=======

This repository is used for team development of an iOS app dubbed "Tracker."
Tracker is being developed for an Information Technology class at the University of Missouri.
The class is IT4500: Team-Based Mobile Application Development. 
This class is unique because it is one of only a handful of classes that teaches iOS's new language, Swift in the entire nation.

"Tracker" itself is unique due to its simplicity in both design and ease of use. This app is being developed in order 
to aid people keep track of certain behaviors. The core function of the app is to count the number of times you perform an action.
As a prototype, we intend to implement a counter which allows the user to increment it each time he/she smokes a cigarette. If the user is consistent in interacting with the app, Tracker will log the number of cigarettes the individual smokes per day. The user can check their progress by data representation for a week or for a month's use. In order to increase consitent user interaction, a "today widget" will also be created for the user so that they can increment the counter without ever opening Tracker. 


The project is available to the public and can be viewed using Xcode.
